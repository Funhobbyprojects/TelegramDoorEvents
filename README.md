# TelegramDoorEvents

With this TelegramDoorEvents project you will receive a notification on your phone as soon as your frontdoor is being unlocked. The other way around you can type a message in your phone, after which you will receive an answer back with the current status of your frontdoor, locked or unlocked.

In short: the solution is built around an ESP8266, a magnet and a reedcontact in your frontdoor and a Telegram bot on your phone. 

Hardware you need:
* ESP8266
* Magnet
* Reedcontact
* some electro components

Software you need:
* Arduino IDE
* Additional Board Manager URL in your Arduino preferences: http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json. (I used ESP8266 Boards 2.7.1)
* ArduinoJson 5.13.5 from Beno√Æt Blanchon
* UniversalTelegramBot 1.1.0 from Brian Lough
* This project software
* Telegram app on your phone
